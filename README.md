# BuddyBotUI Addon for mod-ollama-bot-buddy (WoW 3.3.5)

BuddyBotUI is a debugging addon for the [mod-ollama-bot-buddy](https://github.com/DustinHendrickson/mod-ollama-bot-buddy) AzerothCore module. It provides in-game, movable, and resizable panels displaying real-time bot state, commands, and reasoning information for **World of Warcraft 3.3.5 (Wrath of the Lich King, AzerothCore)**. This enables rapid testing and verification of bot behavior as it interacts with the Ollama LLM and AzerothCore world.

## Requirements

- **AzerothCore** server (3.3.5) running [mod-ollama-bot-buddy](https://github.com/DustinHendrickson/mod-ollama-bot-buddy)
- **World of Warcraft** 3.3.5 client supporting Lua/XML addons (Wrath of the Lich King)
- BuddyBotUI loaded as an enabled addon

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the panels do not appear, confirm that both the mod-ollama-bot-buddy module and BuddyBotUI addon are enabled and that the bot is generating debug output with `[BUDDY_STATE]`, `[BUDDY_COMMAND]`, or `[BUDDY_REASON]` tags in system chat.
- For panel issues, reload your UI with `/reload`.
